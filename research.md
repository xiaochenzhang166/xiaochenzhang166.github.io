### Research

My research primarily revolves around the development and application of advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques for high-dimensional data analysis. The key areas of my current research are:

- **Self-supervised Feature Extraction**: Developing interpretable feature extraction methods for complex, high-dimensional tabular data using a self-supervised learning approach, integrated with statistical rigor to enhance feature selection accuracy.
  
- **Variable Selection and Knockoff Framework**: Exploring novel methods for variable selection in high-dimensional datasets using the **Knockoff Framework**. This research focuses on improving variable selection accuracy and predictive performance by leveraging over-parameterized regression techniques.

- **Benign Overfitting in Sparse Linear Models**: Investigating the properties of linear models under benign overfitting conditions, particularly in sparse data settings, and studying the impact of sparsity assumptions on model performance.

### Ongoing Projects

Here are some of the ongoing projects I'm currently working on:

- **[Interpretable Feature Synthesis via Statistical Self-supervised Learning](#)**: In this project, I develop methods to synthesize interpretable features from complex datasets using statistical self-supervised learning techniques, enhancing the interpretability and explainability of machine learning models.

- **[Benign Overfitting in Sparse Linear Regression](#)**: A study focusing on the theoretical exploration of benign overfitting phenomena in sparse regression settings and its implications on model estimation and prediction.
