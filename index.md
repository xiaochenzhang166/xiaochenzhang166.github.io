## About Me
Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at the Research Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences, Shandong University. My research interests are primarily focused on advanced statistical methods, machine learning, and high-dimensional data analysis. I specialize in feature selection, statistical modeling, and developing interpretable machine learning frameworks. With a robust background in both theoretical and applied statistics, I am passionate about advancing the understanding of complex data structures and improving predictive performance in high-dimensional datasets.

## Recent Updates
- ðŸŽ‰ New paper titled **"Knoop: Practical Enhancement of Knockoff with Over-Parameterization for Variable Selection"** accepted in *Machine Learning* (IF = 5.8), 2024.
- ðŸ’¡ I am actively looking for collaborative research opportunities in statistical modeling, machine learning, and high-dimensional data analysis. Feel free to reach out to discuss potential projects.
